What started out as a passion for languages that only grew as I travelled and lived outside my own country has grown into the beginnings of what I hope will be a useful project for many people.

######NOTE####  
Currently this project is in major production mode. Working with transliterations of ISO standard of transliterations in linguistics. 

1. Also will export all the words in the corpuses imported into this project into a postgres database.
2. then work on more transliterations such as more Syrillic like Serbian, as well as exotic scripts like Georgian (wish me luck!!), as well as others
3. Any transliteration done from Latin to whatever script will go side by side in the database and be static because transliterations never change.
4. Sort function will allow to sort words based on most commonly used, function in a sentence (tokenizing??), and words in different langauges that have something in common with other languages.

If you like learning languages and linguistics in general, I hope you will enjoy this project and find it useful.
